# 📊 LifeGDP: Time Series Analysis and Visualization Using Python and Plotly

Welcome to **LifeGDP**! In this project, we’ll analyze the correlation between a country’s **GDP per capita** and **life expectancy** over a century-long period using **Plotly** for interactive and animated visualizations. We’ll explore trends and insights, perform data cleaning and feature engineering, and create animations that showcase how these variables change over time. Let’s bring data to life with dynamic visual storytelling! 📈🌍

## 🌐 Project Overview

Inspired by Hans Rosling’s famous TED talk, we’ll replicate a century-long animated visualization showing the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy for various countries. Using **Plotly**, we’ll create interactive charts and animations that capture changes over time. This project involves extensive data manipulation, including unpivoting datasets, merging them, and performing feature engineering. In the end, we’ll export the animations as GIFs to illustrate the trends dynamically.
